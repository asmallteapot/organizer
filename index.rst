Organizer
=====================================

At its core, Organizer tries to be a useful CRM for grassroots organizations
that hate using CRMs. No CRM is perfect, and no CRM will fit your organization
exactly right. However, Organizer does have one advantage over other systems: it
is Free/Libre Software you run yourself. This means you own your data, instead
of handing it off to some other for-profit enterprise.
