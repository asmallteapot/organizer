Comrade Relationship Manager
============================

Your organization is vast, and has hundreds, even thousands of members. How do
you find anyone in it?

The *Comrade Relationship manager* (CRM for short) is a tool that tracks data
about people, including:

* Name
* E-Mail
* Phone number
* Address
* Neighborhood
* Tags
* Level of engagement
* Event and meeting attendance

You can access the CRM through the "People" tab on the mobile UI. Build filters
over your data, add/remove tags, and copy lists of e-mails for easy pasting into
your e-mail client.


Importing Spreadsheets
----------------------

The CRM allows you to import an excel, google sheets, or other spreadsheet
using copy-and-paste. Importing a spreadsheet will allow you to match columns to
CRM fields.

Tags can be added to people by add a column to your data that begins with
"tag:". If the column is non-blank, the person will be given that tag.

If an imported email already exists in the CRM, that person will be updated with
the imported data instead of creating a duplicate.

Administration UI
-----------------

There is a more comprehensive UI for the CRM that allows you to create, update,
delete all data in the system. It is only available to administrators through
the upper left app menu. See the :ref:`maintenance` section for more information on
:ref:`administrators` and the :ref:`administration-interface`.
