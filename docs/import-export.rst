Import and Export
=================

Organizer's :ref:`administration-interface` includes buttons for importing and
exporting lists of data in CSV and other formats. Use the filters to narrow your
list, then export it.

Other services are processed by running the import or export sub-commands of
./manage.py.  See :ref:`integrations` for a list of import and export plugins.
