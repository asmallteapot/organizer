Events
======

Organizer's user facing UI allows for members to check-in to events, just like
paper and pen sign-in sheets but without the need to type them all up later on.

Events must have an address and a time in order that they show up for members.
Members can check-in to an event if they've enabled geolocation on their device
and are within 1/4mi of the event's location.

Event attendance can be later viewed through the :ref:`CRM`
